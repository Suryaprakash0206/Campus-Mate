### **Project Description**

**Homepage**
I designed the homepage as a clean entry point with a split layout. The left section displays the Campus Mate logo to establish identity, while the right section contains a card with two clear options: Student Login and Faculty Login. Navigation is handled using React Router, so users can move to the respective login pages without reloading. A soft gradient background and centered layout were used to give a modern and professional look.

**Login Pages (Student & Faculty)**
I created separate login pages for students and faculty with a common layout for consistency. Each page includes input fields for ID and password along with a login button. On successful login (navigation click), the user is redirected to the dashboard. The design focuses on simplicity, using a centered login box, rounded inputs, and subtle shadows to keep the interface user-friendly.

**Dashboard**
The dashboard is structured with a full-width top header displaying the Campus Mate title and logo, followed by the main content area. Below the header, a sidebar provides quick access to sections like Profile, Announcements, Exams, Hackathons, and Drive. The remaining space is used for dashboard cards such as Schedule and Works. Flexbox is used to manage the layout, ensuring clarity, responsiveness, and proper space utilization across different screen sizes.
